Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space.

Conventional methods for constructing density maps are mainly based on Euclidean distance, limiting their applicability in urban analysis that shall consider road network and urban traffic. In this work, we propose a new method named Topology Density Map, targeting for accurate and intuitive density maps in the context of urban environment. Based on the various constraints of road connections and traffic conditions, the method first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that propagates nonlinear scalar fields along 1D road networks. Next, the method extends the scalar fields to a 2D space by identifying key intersecting points in the DAG and calculating the scalar fields for every point, yielding a weighted Voronoi diagram like effect of space division.

However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs.

This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions.

CNNs are preferable for region-wise traffic prediction by taking advantage of localized spatial correlations, whilst GNNs achieves better performance for graph-structured traffic data. When applied to region-wise traffic prediction, CNNs typically partition an underlying territory into grid-like spatial units, and employ standard convolutions to learn spatial dependence among the units. However, standard convolutions with fixed geometric structures cannot fully model the nonstationary characteristics of local traffic flows. To overcome the deficiency, we introduce deformable convolution that augments the spatial sampling locations with additional offsets, to enhance the modeling capability of spatial nonstationarity.

Not only serious traffic jams, but also safety risks are consequently caused. Although many evacuation strategies have been proposed, the spatiotemporal coordination issue of multiple-modal transport tools is not solved well to deal with the efficiency and safety risk during the traditional evacuations. This study presented a large-scale multi-modal transport macro-optimization evacuation model for urban mass gathering events. By taking full advantages of each kind of public transit vehicles and optimizing their spatiotemporal cooperation with pedestrian evacuation, our models can greatly improve the global evacuation efficiency. Experiments on a realistic event was carried to validate the proposed model.

To this end, we integrate intuitive visualizations to unveil the impact dynamics of NFT projects.

Common referent designs include the considerations of referent layout (side-by-side vs. in-situ) and referent size (small vs. medium vs. large). This paper introduces a controlled user study to assess how different referent designs affect the efficiency and accuracy of scale perception across different data scales, on the performance of the size-matching task in the virtual environment. Our results reveal that in-situ layouts significantly enhance accuracy and confidence across various data scales, particularly with large referents. Linear regression analyses further confirm that in-situ layouts exhibit greater resilience to changes in data scale. For tasks requiring efficiency, medium-sized referents emerge as the preferred choice.

Nonetheless, this sense of immersion can be greatly compromised by a blur effect that masks details and hampers the user's ability to engage with objects of interest. In this paper, we present a novel system, called OmniVR, designed to enhance visual clarity during VR navigation. Our system enables users to effortlessly locate and zoom in on the objects of interest in VR. It captures user commands for navigation and zoom, converting these inputs into parameters for the Mobius transformation matrix. Leveraging these parameters, the ODI is refined using a learning-based algorithm. The resultant ODI is presented within the VR media, effectively reducing blur and increasing user engagement. To verify the effectiveness of our system, we first evaluate our algorithm with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets, which achieves the best performance. Furthermore, we undertake a comprehensive user study to evaluate viewer experiences across diverse scenarios and to gather their qualitative feedback from multiple perspectives. The outcomes reveal that our system enhances user engagement by improving the viewers' recognition, reducing discomfort, and improving the overall immersive experience.

However, rendering all trajectories could result in severe visual clutter and incur long visualization delays due to large data volume.

Time-varying stroke gestures are selected as the primary focus because of their prevalence across various applications and their diverse patterns. The commonalities (e.g., features like velocity and curvature) between desktop and VR strokes allow the generation of additional dimensions (e.g., z vectors) in VR strokes. However, distribution shifts exist between different interaction environments (i.e., desktop vs. VR), and within the same interaction environment for different strokes by various users, making it challenging to build models capable of generalizing to unseen distributions.

Conventional methods for higher-order movement modeling first construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of movements, then extract higher-order patterns from the DAG. However, DAG-based methods heavily rely on the identification of movement keypoints that are challenging for sparse movements and fail to consider the temporal variants that are critical for movements in urban environments. To overcome the limitations, we propose HoLens, a novel approach for modeling and visualizing higher-order movement patterns in the context of an urban environment. HoLens mainly makes twofold contributions: first, we design an auto-adaptive movement aggregation algorithm that self-organizes movements hierarchically by considering spatial proximity, contextual information, and temporal variability; second, we develop an interactive visual analytics interface consisting of well-established visualization techniques, including the H-Flow for visualizing the higher-order patterns on the map and the higher-order state sequence chart for representing the higher-order state transitions. Two real-world case studies manifest that the method can adaptively aggregate the data and exhibit the process of how to explore the higher-order patterns by HoLens.

Additionally, we emphasize the significance of storyboard design, focusing on aspects such as logical sequencing, temporal order, map scale and granularity, and interactive design. To validate the effectiveness of our story map design framework, we develop several story map cases centered around the exploration history of Antarctica.

To answer these questions, we develop a computational framework combining neural latent space and aesthetics features with visual analytics to investigate the difference between human and AI paintings. First, with categorical comparison of human and AI painting collections, we find that AI artworks show distributional difference from human artworks in both latent space and some aesthetic features like strokes and sharpness, while in other aesthetic features like color and composition there is less difference. Second, with individual artist analysis of Picasso, we show human artists' strength in evolving new styles compared to AI.
